# `nb` MCP Tools

The `nb` MCP server provides LLM-friendly access to the `nb` note-taking system with proper escaping and project-specific notebook context.

## When to Use
- **Project coordination**: Record handoffs, document project policies and procedures, maintain task lists.
- **Issue tracking**: Create and manage todos with status tracking.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Document patterns, APIs, and project-specific knowledge.
- **Meeting notes**: Record discussions and action items.

## Scope and Noise Control
- Prefer to update an existing related note/todo over creating a new one when context already exists.
- Avoid logging routine, immediately completed mechanical actions in separate notes.
- Create new notes/todos when information is likely to be useful across sessions or for other collaborators.

## Tagging Conventions
Use consistent tags for discoverability:
- **Project Component**: `#component-<name>` (e.g., `#component-data-models`)
- **Task Type**: `#task-<type>` (e.g., `#task-design`, `#task-bug`)
- **Status**: `#status-<state>` (e.g., `#status-in-progress`, `#status-review`)
- **Coordination**: `#handoff`, `#coordination`
- **Assignment**: Avoid owner tags (for example `#llm-*`) for task ownership. Use lane/folder ownership and explicit owner text in the note body when needed.

## Common Patterns
- Check for handoffs: use `search` with `#handoff` and `#status-review` tags.
- Find active component work: use `search` with `#component-<name>` and `#status-in-progress` tags.
- Track todos: use the `todo`, `tasks`, `do`, and `undo` tools.
- Organize with folders: use `folders` and `mkdir`.

## Choosing `todo` vs `add`
- Use the **`todo`** tool for any item with actionable state (open/done): todos, bugs, and issues. This gives the note a checkbox, enables `do`/`undo` state tracking, and makes it appear in `tasks` output.
- Use the **`add`** tool for everything else: coordination notes, decisions, designs, ideas, reference material, handoffs, and meeting notes.
- **Always specify a `folder`** when creating a note. A note created without a folder lands at the notebook root and is invisible to folder-scoped list views.
- Do not duplicate: if a bug or task is already tracked in `issues/<component>/` or `todos/<component>/`, do not also create a matching todo. Reference the existing selector in coordination notes or related todo bodies instead.

## Notebook Identifier Clarification
- Treat note selectors (for example `coordination/mcp/1`) as canonical IDs for operations on existing notes (`show`, `edit`, `delete`, etc.); do not supply a selector when creating new notes.
- Notebook MCP responses may include notebook-scoped identifiers (for example `my-project:coordination/...`) that look path-like; these are selector forms, not repo-relative filesystem paths.
- Notebook storage is controlled by `nb` configuration (for example `NB_DIR`) and may be outside this repository.
- Prefer notebook MCP commands to read/edit notes. Avoid assuming a selector maps to a file under the current repo.
- Use `help` to read full command schemas; key lookups: `search` with tag queries, `tasks` for open todos, `folders` to browse structure.

## Recommended `nb` Organization (Project-Defined)
- Prefer a folder taxonomy of `<issue-type>/<component>` (max depth 2) and avoid mixing top-level component folders with top-level issue-type folders.

- Design rationale belongs in subsystem README files and OpenSpec specs. Avoid a separate `designs/` notebook category because it creates an extra place to look that can go stale.
- Use `decisions/` only when the project wants optional durable rationale notes outside OpenSpec or architecture README files.
- When an idea promotes to a formal OpenSpec proposal, delete or archive the notebook draft so the OpenSpec file is the canonical record.
- Example component names include `engine`, `mcp`, `tui`, `web`, `handbook`, and `data-models`.
- This project should define and document its specific component-folder conventions in @.auxiliary/agents/project.md.
- For cross-component work, prefer `coordination/general` and use multiple `#component-*` tags.
- For tech-lead lane handoffs, prefer `coordination/<component>` (one stable note updated in place).
- Keep notebook lifecycle hygiene:
    - prune completed todos quickly,
    - keep only active/near-term coordination checkpoints,
    - delete stale history-only notes with no owner or action.
- Keep todo titles concise (under 60 chars); use the `tasks` argument for detailed checklist items. This keeps notebook list views readable.

## `nb` vs OpenSpec Rubric
- Use **OpenSpec proposals** for cross-cutting changes, contract-shaping work, architecture shifts, or work that needs explicit design discussion.
- Use **`nb` todos/notes** for scoped, self-contained implementation tasks where the path is straightforward.
- When in doubt about whether work needs an OpenSpec proposal or only `nb` execution tracking, prefer OpenSpec first for design clarity.
- For each active OpenSpec proposal, keep **exactly one** linked `nb` todo as the tracking anchor (with proposal reference), rather than duplicating full task trees in both systems.

## Handoff Hygiene
- **Who maintains handoffs:** coordinators and sole owners maintain project-level rolling handoffs (typically `coordination/general`). Tech leads maintain handoffs for lanes under their purview (`coordination/<component>` or equivalent). No one else maintains a rolling handoff. Coordinated multi-agent teams may be multi-tier (for example coordinator above several tech leads); each tier owns only its scope.
- Keep rolling handoff notes separate from OpenSpec proposal content. Do not repurpose or overwrite rolling handoff notes with proposal content.
- **When to update:** before compaction or planned seat transfer; when the coordinator or operator requests it; or when material state would otherwise be lost (active blocker, uncommitted work, non-obvious decision, external dependency, required next action with no durable task record). Do not update routinely after ordinary commits, merges, tests, review rounds, or status pings when those outcomes are already visible from Git, `nb`, or packets.
- **What goes in a handoff:** a brief summary of recent accomplishments and the current agenda (next accountable action). Include blockers or decisions only when material. Link to todos, issues, commits, or proposals instead of reproducing history.
- Keep the note brief and operational. Replace the body rather than appending checkpoints. A growing chronological log is an anti-pattern.
